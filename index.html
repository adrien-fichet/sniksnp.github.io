                Hi! I'm a Computer Science Master's Degree student living in France, currently
                working as an intern in a french IT consulting company. I'm interested in learning Scala,
                and improving my skills in Java. I also enjoy web development and programming
                in Python.

                        This is a sliding puzzle web application written in vanilla JS and HTML5. I'm doing this
                        project for fun, and also to familiarize myself with web applications performance
                        problems, unit and behavioral testing in Javascript, and various web technologies.
                        The main goal is to develop
                        a functionality allowing the user to play on any image of her choice,
                        with the web application completely running on the client side. The source code is
                        automatically minified on push using Grunt and a custom Python script, and then deployed by
                        <a href="https://travis-ci.org/sniksnp/image-slider-game">Travis CI</a> to

                    <h3>Performance testing of a REST Web service with Gatling</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is my end-of-degree internship project. I'm developing a Java/Scala hybrid application
                        to automate performance testing of the REST Web service of an integrated library system (ILS)
                        marketed as a SaaS. The goal of the project is to find how many simultaneous users
                        the integrated library system can sustain, in order to adapt the production
                        infrastructure as the number of customers grow.
                    </p>
                    <p class="center"><img src="im/gatling.png" alt="" /></p>
                    <p>
                        I chose to use <a href="https://github.com/excilys/gatling">Gatling</a>, an open source stress
                        tool written in Scala, since it is well suited to test a Web service and it makes tests easy to
                        maintain (contrary to JMeter). Furthermore, the fact that it is written in Scala makes it
                        easy to interact with a Java application. The project consists in 3 Java CLI applications
                        organized in Maven modules, used to either restore a test environment
                        from multiple MySQL dumps, generate random test data from a database, or run the performance
                        tests and generate test results. I also wrote a monitoring script which is executed
                        while running the tests, in order to integrate the monitoring measures (CPU, RAM and I/O usage
                        of the different VMs of the test environment) into the results from Gatling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The main challenges of this project are to produce meaningful test data, and to find how to
                        simulate real users behaviors by only sending and receiving Web service requests. Even though
                        I'm part of an agile team of 8 developers, I'm working on performance tests individually but
                        that obviously doesn't prevent me from suggesting new functionalities or discussing the progress
                        of the project with the other team members.

                        This is a typing game I wrote while learning Qt and Python. It was
                        originally written in Python 2.7 with PyQt4, and I recently ported it to Python 3.3/PyQt5.

                        I had used py2exe to create a standalone Windows executable of the application,
                        but unfortunately, py2exe doesn't support Python 3+. PyInstaller seems to be
                        a good alternative to py2exe, but it <a href="http://www.pyinstaller.org/roadmap"> doesn't
                        support Python 3 either</a>, yet. Therefore I chose to use cx_Freeze and
                        Inno Setup to distribute the application as a
