                Hi! I'm a Computer Science Master's Degree student living in France, currently
                working as an intern in a french IT consulting company. I'm interested in learning Scala,
                and improving my skills in Java. I also enjoy web &amp; mobile development, and programming
                in Python.

                    <p>
                        This is a sliding puzzle web application written in pure Javascript. I started this project for
                        fun, but also found it a good way to familiarize myself with web applications performance
                        problems, unit testing in Javascript, and various web technologies. The main goal is to develop
                        a functionality allowing the user to play on any image of her choice,
                        with the web application completely running on the client side. The web application is
                        automatically minified (using Grunt and a custom Python script) and deployed to
                        Github pages by <a href="https://travis-ci.org/sniksnp/image-slider-game">Travis CI</a>.

                        This is the code I write while reading JUnit Recipes: mainly test examples from the book,
                        but also some ideas I have along the way. This project is built using Maven on
                        <a href="https://travis-ci.org/sniksnp/junit_recipes">Travis CI</a>. Code coverage reports
                        are generated using Cobertura, and are automatically pushed to
                        <a href="https://coveralls.io/r/sniksnp/junit_recipes">Coveralls.io</a>.
