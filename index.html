                Hi! I'm a Computer Science Master's Degree student living in France, currently
                working as an intern in a french IT consulting company. I'm interested in learning Scala,
                and improving my skills in Java. I also enjoy web development and programming
                in Python.

            <h3>Application Lifecycle Management Integration Tool development</h3>
            <p>
                I'm currently developing a Java application to synchronize the different
                application lifecycle management (ALM) tools used by
                the agile team I work with during the last 3 months of my end-of-degree internship.
                These tools are
                <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack">YouTrack</a> (issue tracking tool),
                <a href="http://www.pivotaltracker.com">Pivotal Tracker</a> (agile project management tool),
                <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org">Jenkins</a> (continuous integration server) and
                <a href="https://subversion.apache.org">Subversion</a> (version control system).
            </p>
            <p class="center">
                <img src="im/youtrack.png" alt="" />
                <img src="im/pivotal.png" alt="" />
                <img src="im/jenkins.png" alt="" />
                <img src="im/svn.png" alt="" />
            </p>
            <p>
                A PHP application developed by a previous intern already exists to synchronize these tools.
                Unfortunately, it doesn't work with the most recent APIs of YouTrack and Pivotal Tracker
                and is rather hard to maintain.
                Rewriting this PHP application in Java has multiple advantages: first,
                it will be easier to maintain since the agile team members are more familiar with
                Java, and secondly, it will be designed to easily adapt to the most recent YouTrack and Pivotal
                Tracker APIs.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the synchronization tool is ported to Java, I'm also developing a web application
                built on top of the synchronization tool which will show statistics related to the
                agile development process, such as the number of issues reopened during
                each sprint. This web application is directly embedded into the Java application using
                <a href="http://www.sparkjava.com/index.html">Spark</a> and the frontend uses
                <a href="http://dev.sencha.com/ext/5.0.0">ExtJS 5</a>.

            <p>
                "Les Cast Codeurs" is a french Java podcast hosted by Emmanuel Bernard, Arnaud HÃ©ritier, Guillaume
                Laforge, Antonio Goncalves and Vincent Massol. It is primarly focused on the Java ecosystem but
                also deals with various other topics. It is my favourite podcast and I heavily recommend it
                to anyone interested in Java.

            </p>
            <p>
                As a way to thank them for doing this podcast, I suggested to improve their website
                (<a href="http://lescastcodeurs.com">lescastcodeurs.com</a>). Its source code is
                <a href="https://github.com/lescastcodeurs/lescastcodeurs.com">hosted on Github</a>.
                This website is generated using <a href="http://awestruct.org/">Awestruct</a>, and consists in
                blog posts (one for each podcast) and additional information about the podcast.
            </p>
            <p>
                At first, I converted all the old blog posts written in Erb to Markdown in order to have
                a consistent content across the site, since the new blog posts are written in Markdown. I
                used different regular expressions to do that, for example:
            </p>
            <pre>sed -r 's!&lt;a href="(.*)"&gt;(.*)&lt;/a&gt;![\2](\1)!g' blog-post.erb</pre>
            <p>
                to convert the HTML &lt;a&gt; tags to Markdown links. I also fixed typos and formatting
                errors along the way. I'm currently working on re-designing the look-and-feel of the website,
                the goal being to make it look more "modern".

            <p>
                SQLite DB Viewer was an GUI application I developed with a friend in 2012 as part of an
                university project. It was written in Python 2.6 with PyQt. As its name suggest, its
                goal was to provide a visualization of the content of a SQLite database (data and structure).
                We also developed a functionality that creates an entity-relationship diagram from
                the database structure (similar to the "reverse engineering" functionality in MySQL Workbench),
                which facilitates the general understanding of the database structure.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm currently rewriting this application from scratch using Java 8, Java FX and jOOQ.

            <h3>Performance testing of a REST web service with Gatling (2014)</h3>
            <p>
                This was the first part of my end-of-degree internship (3 first months out of 6).
                I developed a Java/Scala hybrid application
                to automate performance testing of the REST web service of an integrated library system (ILS)
                marketed as a SaaS. The goal was to find how many simultaneous users
                the integrated library system could sustain, in order to adapt the production
                infrastructure as the number of customers grow.
            </p>
            <p class="center"><img src="im/gatling.png" alt="" /></p>
            <p>
                I chose to use <a href="https://github.com/excilys/gatling">Gatling</a>, an open source stress
                tool written in Scala, since it is well suited to test a web service and it makes tests easy to
                maintain (contrary to JMeter). Furthermore, the fact that it is written in Scala makes it
                easy to interact with a Java application. The project consists in 3 Java CLI applications
                organized in Maven modules, used to either restore a test environment
                from multiple MySQL and Solr dumps, generate random test data from a database,
                and run the performance tests and generate test results.
                I also wrote a monitoring script which is executed
                while running the tests, in order to integrate the monitoring measures (CPU, RAM and I/O usage)
                of the different VMs of the test environment into the results from Gatling. The monitoring of
                the ILS backend, provided by <a href="https://code.google.com/p/javamelody">JavaMelody</a>,
                is also integrated into these results.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main challenges of this project were to produce meaningful test data, and to
                simulate real users behaviors by only sending and receiving web service requests.
                I worked in an agile team of 8 developers and also closely with the system admin team in order
                to execute the performance tests on a pre-production environment.

            <p>
                This is a sliding puzzle web application written in vanilla JS and HTML5. I started this
                project for fun and also to familiarize myself with web applications performance
                problems, testing in Javascript, and various web technologies.
                The main goal was to develop a functionality allowing the user to play on any image of her
                choice, with the web application completely running on the client side. The source code is
                automatically minified on push using Grunt and a custom Python script, and then deployed by
                <a href="https://travis-ci.org/sniksnp/image-slider-game">Travis CI</a> to
                <a href="http://sniksnp.github.io/image-slider-game">sniksnp.github.io/image-slider-game</a>.

            <p>
                I also added the possibility to take a picture (from a webcam or a phone camera) and play on
                it. Last but not least, you can let the application solve the puzzle for you by clicking on
                the robot icon.

            <h3>Web interface to a command line tool with Node.js and Bootstrap (2013)</h3>
            <p>
                This is by far the most interesting project I worked on at university. We had to work in
                a team of 2, and the goal was to develop a web interface to a command line tool,
                created by computer scientists of our university, in order to simplify its use
                (SaaS instead of a complicated command line interface).
            </p>
            <p class="center"><img src="im/web_interface.jpg" alt="" /></p>
            <p>
                We chose to use Node.js since it was well suited to develop an asynchronous
                application such as this one, and Bootstrap/jQuery for the front end. These technologies
                enabled a really fast development pace: we were able to ship a prototype in
                only one week. We then added new functionalities on top of it, such as sending emails,
                input/output processing, and a <a href="http://rise4fun.com">rise4fun</a> web service.
                We also automated non-regression testing of the tool and wrote an extensive documentation
                of the web interface and the tool itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                We tried to apply agile methodologies as much as we could, which helped
                us a lot to adapt the web application to the constant requirement changes
                from our product owner. It was also very interesting and rewarding to get
                suggestions and positive feedback from the end users throughout the project.

                as well as on mobile web browsers, therefore I chose to use the WebAudio API instead of Flash.
                As a consequence, it won't work on older browsers. Even though this soundboard is very silly,
                I had a lot of fun developing it and seeing it being used on stream!

            <h3>Porting of an embedded system application to PC (2012)</h3>
            <p>
                My end-of-bachelor's degree internship consisted in porting a software installed
                on parking pay-and-display machines to PC. This software, written in C,
                was designed to work on ARM7 processors. My role was to modify it so that
                it could be run on x86 processors. This internship lasted 6 months.
            </p>
            <p>
                The aim of porting the application to PC was to facilitate the
                development of functional tests, therefore it was not judged useful to completely
                rewrite all the low-level components of the embedded
                system (based on OpenBSD 3.8). Instead, I mocked the interfaces of the pay-and-display
                machine peripherals and modified the code of the application in order to use
                PC-compatible libraries, such as pthread instead of a proprietary multithreading library.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although this project was rather tedious, I managed to achieve most of its objectives.
                Unfortunately, I couldn't mock all of the peripherals since some of them were
                really complex and sometimes proprietary (the card reader for example). All in all, it was
                a great way to discover the world of embedded software and to face interesting challenges
                unique to it, such as being limited to only 128k of disk space. That was also the first
                time I worked with an agile team (8 members, mainly XP).

            <p>
                Hadouken Jump is a simple game I made in one day after playing SSF4 with a friend
                whose playstyle could be summed up as "spam-hadoukens-as-fast-as-you-can".
                The only aim of the game is therefore to jump over hadoukens. It was coded in Python
                with Panda 3D (a game engine I was experimenting with at that time).

                This is a typing game I wrote while learning Qt and Python. It was

            </p>
            <p>
                I had used py2exe to create a standalone Windows executable of the application,
                but unfortunately, py2exe doesn't support Python 3+. PyInstaller seems to be
                a good alternative to py2exe, but it <a href="http://www.pyinstaller.org/roadmap"> doesn't
                support Python 3 either</a> (yet). Therefore I chose to use cx_Freeze and
                Inno Setup to distribute the application as a
                <a href="https://github.com/sniksnp/typing_game/raw/master/dist/typing_game-setup.exe">

            <h3>iPhone and iPad applications development (2011)</h3>
            <p>
                My first internship as a developer consisted in developing an iPhone application for
                a bus company and making it available on the App Store. The application can be used
                to calculate a route between 2 bus stops, find the
                nearest bus stops from the current location, display bus lines on a map
                and buy a ticket by SMS.
            </p>
            <p class="center">
                <img src="im/iphone1.jpg" alt="" />
                <img src="im/iphone2.jpg" alt="" />
            </p>
            <p>
                Informations about the bus network are provided by a real-time passenger information system
                (PIS). For instance, the users can search a bus stop by name and instantly know
                when the next buses will pass. I had the responsability to publish this application on the
                App Store, which took quite some time but was successful. Unfortunately, this iPhone
                application is not maintained anymore and since it was developed for iOS 4, it probably
                won't work on current iPhone devices (iOS 7).
            </p>
            <p>
                I've been hired by the bus company at the end of my internship for 1 month in order
                to develop a completely different application, for iPad, used by some of the bus
                company employees. Basically, its
                goal was to track a user's position and to send these positions to a FTP server
                in KMZ format.
